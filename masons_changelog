!!COOKIES ARE DONE
- topbar will now display a welcome page if you are logged in
- log in has a remember me option which sets cookies, cookies are set to null by logout page.
- DO NOT DELETE COOKIES, THE SITE SEEMS TO CRASH. might have just been a syntax error i fixed
but still try to be careful.

I think that was the last of my duties, please inform me if i missed something.


!!LOGIN NOW AVAIABLE
all files will need to use mainHeader for session to function, you can use the $_SESSION["user"] variable as 
part of your select or insert statements, so either:

stmt = prepare->("select * from user where username = ?");
stmt->execute([$_SESSION["user"]]);

or

stmt = prepare->("select * from user where username = :user");
stmt->bindParam(":user", $_SESSION("user"));
stmt->execute();

should work fine. also, add:
if(!isset($_SESSION['user'])){
        header("location: login.php");
}
to any page where you would need to be logged in to see. most likely post and myposts will
need the login check. put this code RIGHT underneath include mainheader.
    
    
    


!! TO LOAD THE DATABASE, CD INTO our_db AND RUN mysql -u root -p db < db.sql 
!! OR RUN mysql -u root, THEN RUN source db.sql
!! either should work, but you hve to be in the same directory




shell> mysqldump --all-databases > db.sql


    shell> mysqldump --databases db1 db2 db3 > filename.sql
    //don't need --databases if dumping only one database
    shell> mysqldump test > filename.sql
    //can also dump only tables from a database
    shell> mysqldump test t1 t3 t7 > filename.sql
    



//if you are already running mysql, you can execute an SQL script file using the source command or \. command:
mysql> source file_name
mysql> \. file_name




!! PAY ATTENTION TO THIS ONE
!! this is a foreach loop that iterates through a search querry, could be vital for multiple images per item

<?php
